First step is to create an account with your email address. You may choose to use a pre-existing wallet or we’ll create one for you for your profile. If you are a creator and have received a Creator Pass, complete your profile and choose the social causes you care about. You are now allowed to upload your creations to your profile or submit them into our Curation Pool, where galleries (brands, curators, and communities) can find your work and choose to collaborate with you by either hosting your work for a drop or promoting it for sale within their gallery space. If you are a social cause, you can sign up to be a part of our eligible organizations from which creators can choose to donate a portion of their proceeds to. If you are a collector you can discover new creations, support creators, collect limited edition works, generate positive impact, and more."
